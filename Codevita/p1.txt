Problem : Image Segmentation

Consider an image represented using grid of height H and width W. This image consists of blobs. A blob is a collection of contiguous lit pixels. A non-lit pixel is represented using '.' and a lit pixel is represented using '#'.

In 2D, pixels are said to be contiguous if they are 8-way connected. Refer [wiki] for more details on how connections are represented mathematically.

Your task is to find the number of blobs in given grid. Also, state the number of lit pixels in each blob.

Input Format:

First line contains T, number of test cases.

Each test case consists of:

    Grid dimensions : - Two integers H (height) and W (width)
    The Grid : - Next H lines each comprising of W characters {'.' | '#'}


Output Format:

For each test case print two lines.

First line should contain the number of blobs.

Second line should contain number of lit pixels in those blobs in sorted order (smallest first) delimited by space.

Constraints:

1. 1 <= T <= 10

2. 1 <= H <= 1000

3. 1 <= W <= 1000
