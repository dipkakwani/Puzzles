Problem : Occurrences in a Range

Given a range of numbers, find specific patterns in them and print the count of numbers that match the pattern. Patterns are of 3 type viz. Alternate, Consecutive and Wildcard. Each pattern is described as below

Alternate: - The verb denoting Alternate is A. As the name suggests, alternate pattern requires detection of numbers which have specified digit in alternate place.

Consecutive: - The verb denoting Consecutive is C. As the name suggests, consecutive pattern requires detection of numbers which has specified digit in required frequency appearing in consecutive manner.

Wildcard: - The verb denoting Wildcard is W. As the name suggests, wildcard pattern requires detection of numbers in which 'W' character can be replaced by any digit.

Input Format:

    First line contains total number of test cases, denoted by N
    Second line contains a range within which to detect the patterns. Range is provided in form of 2 numbers, viz. lower bound and upper bound, both inclusive, delimited by space.
    Next N lines contain pattern queries where patterns are as described above. Input format of each pattern is described as below
        A1 - denotes, find all numbers in the range which have digit 1 in alternate places
        C21 - denotes, find all numbers in the range where digit 1 appears consecutively at least twice. Formally, this pattern follows grammar <C><frequency><digit>
        1W - denotes, find all numbers in the range where 1 precedes any other digit. Read constraints section carefully before implementing this pattern.


Output Format:

For each test case, print count of numbers in the range matching the corresponding pattern. Print each count on a separate line.

Constraints:

1. When solving Wildcard query, the pattern always starts with a digit

2. W character in wildcard query can be substituted by exactly one digit
